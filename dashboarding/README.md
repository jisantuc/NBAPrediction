dashboarding
============

This is a small dashboard example with a `HoverTool` + tooltips and the ability
to view prediction accuracy in either the train or test data based on the
season, the spread, or whether the prediction was for the home team to cover or
not cover.

To run, make sure you're in a `virtualenv` with `bokeh==0.11` and execute `bokeh
serve --show make_dashboard.py`
